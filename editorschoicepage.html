<h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>

	<ol>
		<li> Prepare your glass for serving with  2 or 3 large ice cubes. Additionally, feel free coat the rim of the glass in salt or a paprika/chili and salt mix, depending on how spicy you are feeling. Then set it aside until you have shaken all the ingredients together. </li>

		<li> Add all your cilantro and cucumber to a cocktail shaker and muddle them together until they are thoroughly juiced.</li>

		<li> Fill your shaker about halfway with ice and add the mezcal, lime juice, agave syrup, and triple sec. Feel free to skimp on the agave, lime, and triple sec if you want a less sweet drink that really lets the naturally smoky falvor of the mezcal to come out.</li>

		<li> Loosely strain the contents of your shaker into your prepared glass and serve. Any additional cucumber can be used as a garnish on the rim of your glass along with a sprig of cilantro.
