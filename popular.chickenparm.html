<h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>

	<ol>
		<li> Preheat an oven to approximately 450 degrees farenheit. </li>

		<li> Place your chicken breast halves in a heavy freezer bag or between two pieces of strong plastic on a sturdy cutting board. Pound the chicken with either the smooth side of a meat mallet or your hands until they are approximately half and inch thick. Remove your chicken from the bag and season with salt and pepper.</li>

		<li> Sprinkle flour over your chicken breasts, coating both sides evenly. Set aside. </li>

		<li> To prepare your dredge and breading, begin by beating your eggs in a shallow bowl or pan. Then, mix your bread crumbs and 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese in a different bowl and set aside. </li>

		<li> Bring everything together within easy reach. Take one of your floured chicken breasts and dip into the beaten egg mixture, thoroughly coating it. Then transfer the breast into the bread crumb and parmesan mix, making sure that the breast is completely breaded. Repeat this process for each piece of chicken, and then let the breasts rest for about 10 minutes. </li>

		<li> Heat your olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat until it begins to shine. Fry the chicken in the hot oil until they are a nice golden brown, approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes a side. Don't worry if your chicken is not cooked all the way through, it will finish in the oven.  </li>

		<li> Transfer your chicken to a baking dish and top each piece with one or two tablespoons of tomato sauce. Be careful not to add too much and soak your chicken. Add your mozzarella slices atop each piece along with your basil or italian seasoning. Then, sprinkle whatever parmesan you have left over the top, drizzle on a little olive oil. </li>

		<li> Bake in the oven until the cheese is browned and the chicken is cooked through, approximately 20 minutes. Serve each piece on top of a bed of spaghetti and serve hot. Garnish with fresh basil, or other italian herbs. </li>
