			<h1>About the No-Scroll Cookbook</h1>

			<article class="aboutUs">
				<p>
				The No-Scroll Cookbook was founded after the perfect combination of two, completely unrelated events. The first being NSC's creator, Andrew Burke's growing dissatisfaction with the state of the online recipe world. Sick and tired of being forced to scroll through pages and pages of silly anectdotes, personal stories, and unnecessary commentary before even arriving to an igredients list, Burke decided that enough was enough.

				<p>
				And that brings us to the second event that brought about the creation of the No-Scroll Cookbook- in the fall of 2023, Burke, who was taking an information technologies class, was assigned to create a functioning website. It presented the perfect opportunity for Burke to create the No-Scroll Cookbook, a simple yet elegant solution to the moral decay of the online recipe industry. Featuring no personal anectdotes, limited commentary on serving, and only the simplest of descriptions, the No-Scroll Cookbook is among the first of its kind. We hope you enjoy the recipes already featured on the website and be sure to check back in every once in a while because there will definitely be more to come.</p>
